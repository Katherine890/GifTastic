# GifTastic

An app dedicated to superhero gifs using the Giphy API. An input box to add new superheroes is included. 

This app allows users to search for gifs on superheroes. If a superhero is not listed, users can add a new hero by typing the superhero's name in the input box and clicking the "Add a Hero" button.

The superhero searh is useful for those who are superhero fans (Marvel or DC), and seek entertainment. It's great for those who want to share relatable gifs of their favorite fictional characters.

Users can get started by clicking on the deployed link below.
